          notes="So let's look at a some real-world examples. I tried to pick a place that would be familiar and recognizable. This is (how do you say that?). I'm sure most of you already know about it, but there used to be a palace here where the Kings lived. But in the mid-18th century, there was an earthquake and tsunami that destroyed the palace and much of the city. Instead of rebuilding the palace here, they left it open and I guess they felt bad for the King at the time, so they made a statue of him on a horse and put that right in the middle. I'm going to click on this link and we take look a few things around this area."

          notes="So that's what the map looks like. How do we make edits to it? [click] First, go to openstreetmap.org [click] sign up for a new account [click] and start mapping. I should note that there are two main ways that people edit OpenStreetMap. There is the interface that we just saw, and I'll be using that because it is easier to get started with. It is called the iD editor. There is also a popular desktop editing client called JOSM, but it requires an install and has a steeper learning curve. If you get really into OSM it is worth investing some time in, but we'll be just working with the iD editor. So I'll demo that now..."

          notes="Also want to point out a few resources that are good for starting out. LearnOSM is a website dedicated to teaching people how to map and use OSM data. It's got some really good guides and tutorials. The OSM wiki is the source of OSM truth. It can be a little bit unweildy, and takes a little bit of getting used to, but is the best resource for finding out things like 'which tag should I use for X?'. And finally, mapbox is a really cool company that does a lot with OpenStreetMap and they put together another good set of documentation that gets into some of the more advanced stuff like using the JOSM editor"
